# Rust CAS

I'd wanted to write

1. a ray-tracing engine
2. a physics simulator
3. an automatic gradient descent library
4. or just something in Rust,

but these all rely on computer algebra, and Rust didn't have anything I deemed solid. This is my attempt at trying to make one.

Features:

- CUDA/WebGPU
- Lazy
- Everything is a tensor
